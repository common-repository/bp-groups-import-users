BP GROUPS IMPORT USERS helps users to import bulk users into a buddypress group.

== Description ==
BP GROUPS IMPORT USERS plugin is a free plugin developed to help users to bulk import users into a buddypress group.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use my existing WordPress theme? =

Yes, you can use your existing theme which uses buddypress groups.

= Do I need buddypress groups component to be enabled? =

Yes, you need buddypress groups component to be enabled as this plugin is developed for adding bulk users to buddypress groups.

= What file format I need to upload to add the bulk users to the group? =

You need to create a CSV file to upload bulk users to the buddypress groups.

= What happens if the email Id I entered in the CSV file doesn't exists? =

If the email id doesn't exists on the website then a new user will be registered on the website automatically and an activation email will be sent to them.

= The news user is not appearing in the group members? =

The new users will have to activate their account and login on the website once. After that only the buddypress recognises the user as a member.

= Its taking a lot of time to import users? =

If the number of users are less then it will not take much time. But if the number of users in the CSV are more like more than 500+ or 1000+ then it will take time to process the CSV. So its better to break the CSV file into small CSV files to import more number of users at a time.
